Blockchain Implementation in Java

This repository demonstrates a simple blockchain implementation in Java, showcasing the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology.

Overview-

A blockchain is a special kind of digital record that keeps track of information in a way thatâ€™s secure, shared by many people, and nearly impossible to change once it's been written. This project provides a basic example of how such a system can be implemented using Java.

Features-

Block Structure: Each block contains a value, a hash of the current block, and a hash of the previous block.

Chain Validation: Ensures the integrity of the blockchain by verifying the hash of each block.

Project Structure-

Block.java: Defines the structure of a block in the blockchain.

Main.java: Contains the logic to create and manage the blockchain.
